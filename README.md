# GTA-MP3-Randomizer
Contains code of the rewritten GTA MP3 Randomizer.

## What is this?

This is the GTA MP3 Randomizer that can randomly rename files in a folder to randomize the music in GTA III, VC and SA that was added to the 'mp3' folder. 
This is the second version that used to be in beta for a long time but has always been a lot more stable than the first version (which froze a lot).


I decided to make the code publicly available so people can help improve it if they want. I will check the issues and pull requests every now and then and release a new version if needed.

The code (especially the algorithms) are a bit of a mess but they work and the entire application was made rather quickly years ago when I had less experience so whatever :P.

## Where to download the latest version?

You can find the latest version on the [Releases tab](https://github.com/Earleys/GTA-MP3-Randomizer/releases)

## How to use

Select the path of the 'mp3' folder. After that most of it should be clear. If the application does not start, make sure the .dll file is in the same folder as the exe. 

The application will rename all music files in this folder, so **be sure to have a BACKUP!** In theory the application keeps track of the original names and will try to restore them when you close the application or when you press the 'Recover songs' button, but better safe than sorry.
