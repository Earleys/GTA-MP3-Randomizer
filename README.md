# GTA-MP3-Randomizer
Contains code of the rewritten GTA MP3 Randomizer.

## What is this?

This is the GTA MP3 Randomizer that can randomly rename files in a folder to randomize the music in GTA III, VC and SA.
I decided to make the code publicly available so people can help improve it if they want. I will check the issues and pull requests every now and then and release a new version if needed.

The code could be cleaner but it was made rather quickly years ago when I was still fairly new to programming so I guess it's all right.
This is the second version that used to be in beta for a long time but has always been a lot more stable than the first version (which froze a lot).

## Where to download the latest version?

You can find the latest version on the [Releases tab](https://github.com/Earleys/GTA-MP3-Randomizer/releases)
